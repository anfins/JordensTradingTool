We ended 2024 with strong Q4 performance, as nearly all 
of our KPIs exceeded guidance and profitability reached 
record levels. MAU net additions of 35 million marked the 
largest Q4 in our history and exceeded guidance by 10 
million. Subscriber net additions of 11 million also 
significantly outperformed, surpassing guidance by 3 
million. Revenue was ahead of plan due to favorable 
currency movements and underlying strength in the 
business. Gross Margin of 32.2% was above guidance 
and up 555 bps Y/Y.  Operating Income of €477 million 
was slightly below our guidance as Gross Profit strength 
and lower personnel and related and marketing costs 
were more than offset by €96 million in Social Charges. 
Social Charges were €80 million above forecast due to 
share price appreciation during the quarter. Free Cash 
Flow* reached €877 million in Q4, bringing full year 2024 
Free Cash Flow generation to €2.3 billion.
Looking into 2025, we view the business as well 
positioned to deliver another year of continued growth and 
improving margins as we reinvest to support our long-term 
potential.

Revenue
Profitability
Free Cash Flow
& Liquidity
Gross Margin was 32.2% in Q4, up 555 bps Y/Y reflecting: 
●
Premium gains driven by audiobooks and music; and
●
Ad-Supported gains driven by music and podcasts (partially offset by real estate impairment activity); and
●
Other Costs of Revenue favorability, which benefited both the Premium and Ad-Supported segments
Operating Income was €477 million in Q4 and reflected: 
●
Lower personnel and related costs and lower marketing spend, partially offset by
●
€96 million in Social Charges
At the end of Q4, our workforce consisted of 7,261 full-time employees globally
Revenue of €4,242 million grew 16% Y/Y in Q4 (or 17% Y/Y constant currency*), reflecting: 
●
Premium Revenue growth of 17% Y/Y (or 19% Y/Y constant currency*), driven by subscriber gains 
and ARPU increases; and 
●
Ad-Supported Revenue growth of 7% Y/Y (or 6% Y/Y constant currency*)
●
Unfavorable currency movements slowed Total Revenue Y/Y growth by ~160 bps vs. guidance for 
~350 bps
Free Cash Flow* was €877 million in Q4. Our liquidity and balance sheet remained strong, with €7.5 billion in 
cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short term investments. 
Financial Summary
* Constant Currency adjusted measures and Free Cash Flow are non-IFRS measures. See "Use of Non-IFRS Measures" and "Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results" for additional information.
Premium Revenue grew 17% Y/Y to €3,705 million (or 19% Y/Y constant 
currency*), reflecting subscriber growth of 11% Y/Y and a Premium 
ARPU increase of 5% Y/Y to €4.85 (or up 7% Y/Y constant currency*). 
Excluding the impact of FX, ARPU performance was driven by price 
increase benefits, partially offset by product/market mix.
Ad-Supported Revenue grew 7% Y/Y (or 6% Y/Y constant currency*), 
reflecting Y/Y growth across all regions. Both Music and Podcast 
advertising was driven by growth in impressions sold, partially offset by 
softness in pricing. Our automated sales channels were the largest 
contributors to overall advertising growth.  
Advertising growth in challenging brand environment

* Constant Currency adjusted measures are non-IFRS measures. See "Use of Non-IFRS Measures" and "Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results" for additional information. 
ARPU means Premium Average Revenue per User. 
* Last Twelve Months (LTM) represents annual performance covering the preceding 12 months relative to the last day of the quarter.
Premium growth driven by Subscriber and ARPU gains
Premium Gross Margin was 34.7% in Q4, up 
565 bps Y/Y. The Y/Y trend was driven by 
favorability from audiobooks, music and 
Other Costs of Revenue.
Gross Margin
Driven by continued improvement across Premium and Ad-Supported segments
Gross Margin finished at 32.2% in Q4, up 555 
bps Y/Y. The Y/Y trend was driven by 
improvements in our Premium and 
Ad-Supported segments. 
Ad-Supported Gross Margin was 15.1% 
in Q4, up 351 bps Y/Y. The Y/Y trend was 
driven by favorability from music, Other Cost 
of Revenue and podcasts, partially offset by 
real estate impairment activity.
Operating Expenses declined 16% Y/Y in Q4. Currency 
movements and changes in Social Charge movements 
elevated Y/Y Operating Expense growth by ~200 bps and ~700 
bps, respectively, while the lapping of prior year efficiency 
charges contributed ~1,300 bps of Operating Expense decline. 
Absent these items, the remaining 11% Y/Y decline in 
Operating Expenses was driven primarily by a decrease in 
personnel and related costs and lower marketing spend. 
As a reminder, Social Charges are payroll taxes associated
with employee salaries and benefits in select countries where
we operate. Since a portion of these taxes is tied to the intrinsic 
value of share-based compensation awards, movements in our 
stock price can lead to fluctuations in the taxes we accrue. This 
resulted in Social Charges related to share-based 
compensation of €96 million in the current period. Prior year 
period Operating Expenses included €33 million in Social 
Charges.

Y/Y declines led by efficiency initiatives

* Last Twelve Months (LTM) represents annual performance covering the preceding 12 months relative to the last day of the quarter.
Free Cash Flow
Record performance aids balance sheet strength 
Free Cash Flow* was €877 million in Q4, a record high 
as a result of higher Net Income adjusted for non-cash 
items and a positive contribution from net working 
capital. Capital expenditures rose €5 million Y/Y to €6 
million. 
While the magnitude of Free Cash Flow can fluctuate 
from quarter to quarter based on seasonality and timing, 
we have averaged €661 million of positive Free Cash 
Flow on a trailing 12 month basis for the past three 
years. In Q4, trailing 12 month Free Cash Flow 
expanded to €2.3 billion. On a cumulative basis, we 
have generated €4.3 billion of Free Cash Flow since the 
beginning of 2016, supporting our strong balance sheet 
and €7.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, restricted 
cash and short term investments balance.
* Free Cash Flow is a non-IFRS measure. See "Use of Non-IFRS Measures" and "Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results" for additional information" to be consistent with other slides. Last Twelve Months (LTM) 
represents annual performance covering the preceding 12 months relative to the last day of the quarter. Cume represents cumulative performance since the beginning of 2016.

Use of Non-IFRS Measures
To supplement our financial information presented in accordance with IFRS, we use the following non-IFRS financial measures: Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange 
effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, gross profit excluding foreign exchange effect, Operating expense excluding foreign exchange effect, and Free Cash Flow. Management believes that 
Revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Premium revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, Ad-Supported revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, gross profit excluding foreign exchange effect, and Operating 
expense excluding foreign exchange effect, are useful to investors because they present measures that facilitate comparison to our historical performance. However, these should be considered in addition to, not as a 
substitute for or superior to, Revenue, Premium revenue, Ad-Supported revenue, Gross Profit, Operating expense, or other financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. Management believes that Free Cash 
Flow is useful to investors because it presents a measure that approximates the amount of cash generated that is available to repay debt obligations, to make investments, and for certain other activities that exclude 
certain infrequently occurring and/or non-cash items. However, Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, net cash flows (used in)/from operating activities or other financial 
measures prepared in accordance with IFRS. For more information on these non-IFRS financial measures, please see “Reconciliation of IFRS to Non-IFRS Results” section below.

“should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “seek,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential,” “continue,” “contemplate,” “possible,” and similar words are intended to identify estimates and forward-looking statements. 
Our estimates and forward-looking statements are mainly based on our current expectations and estimates of future events and trends, which affect or may affect our businesses and operations. Although we believe that 
these estimates and forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, they are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties and are made in light of information currently available to us. Many important 
factors may adversely affect our results as indicated in forward-looking statements. These factors include, but are not limited to: our ability to attract prospective users, retain existing users, and monetize our products and 
services; competition for users, their time, and advertisers; risks associated with our international operations and our ability to manage our growth and the scope and complexity of our business; risks associated with our 
new products or services and our emphasis on long-term user engagement over short-term results; our ability to predict, recommend, and play content that our users enjoy; our ability to generate profit or positive cash flow 
on a sustained basis; our ability to convince advertisers of the benefits of our advertising offerings; our ability to forecast or optimize advertising inventory amid evolving industry trends in digital advertising; our ability to 
generate revenues from podcasts, audiobooks, and other non-music content; potential disputes or liabilities associated with content made available on our premium service and ad-supported service (collectively, the 
“Service”); risks relating to acquisitions, investments, and divestitures; our dependence upon third-party licenses for most of the content we stream; our lack of control over third-party content providers who are 
concentrated and can unilaterally affect our access to content; our ability to comply with complex license agreements; our ability to accurately estimate royalty payments under our license agreements and relevant statutes; 
the limitations on our operating flexibility due to financial commitments required under certain of our license agreements; our ability to identify the compositions embodied in sound recordings and ownership thereof in order 
to obtain licenses or comply with existing license agreements; assertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights; our ability to protect our intellectual property; the 
dependence of streaming on operating systems, online platforms, hardware, networks, regulations, and standards that we do not control; our ability to maintain the integrity of our technology infrastructure and systems or 
the security of confidential information; undetected errors, misconfigurations, bugs, or vulnerabilities in our products and services; interruptions, delays, or discontinuations in service arising from our systems or systems of 
third parties; changes in laws or regulations affecting us; risks relating to privacy and data security, content moderation, and use of artificial intelligence; our ability to maintain, protect, and enhance our brand; risks 
associated with increased scrutiny of environmental, social, and governance matters; payment acceptance-related risks; our dependence on key personnel and ability to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled 
employees; our ability to access additional capital to support strategic objectives; risks relating to currency exchange rate fluctuations and foreign exchange controls; the impact of economic, social, or political conditions, 
including inflation, changes in interest rates, geopolitical conflicts in Europe and the Middle East, and related market uncertainty; our ability to accurately estimate user metrics and other estimates; our ability to manage 
and remediate attempts to manipulate streams and attempts to gain or provide unauthorized access to certain features of our Service; risks related to our indebtedness, including risks related to our Exchangeable Notes; 
fluctuation of our operating results and fair market value of ordinary shares; tax-related risks; the concentration of voting power among our founders, which limits shareholders’ ability to influence our governance and 
business; and risks related to our status as a foreign private issuer and a Luxembourg company. A detailed discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ 
materially from our estimates and forward-looking statements is included in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including our Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on February 
8, 2024, as updated by subsequent reports filed with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this shareholder update.

Meaningful movements in our stock price can lead to Social Charge variance
Our guidance incorporates the impact of Social Charges, the vast majority of which appear in Operating Expenses. The amount of 
Social Charges we accrue for and ultimately pay can be volatile, as they are tied to the value of our share price. Since we do not 
forecast stock price changes in our guidance, meaningful movements in our stock price over the course of a quarter can lead to 
meaningful changes in Social Charges. As an example, at the Q4 close, our stock price was $447.38. In Q4, a 10% increase or 
decrease in our stock price compared to the quarter-end price would have an approximate +/- €33M impact on Social Charges.
