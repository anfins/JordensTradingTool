# JordensTradingTool

I created this project to assist myself when evaluating stocks. 

There are three parts to this project:

The first is using the yfinance package to extract a company's relevant financial data.

The second is using beautiful soup to scrape for a company's financial records, and using pymupdf package to read from the pdfs.
